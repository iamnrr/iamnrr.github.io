# Project 1

Project Name: Topic Modelling - Pipeline Implementation.

Project Description:

In this project, I tried to implement end to end pipeline operations with various workflows for preprocessing the data, building models and using the built model to perform topic modelling.

I tried creating an actual project environment using configuration files to make the program dynamic. I have removed the source files due to space constraint. I will try to re-publish the project with proper title.
