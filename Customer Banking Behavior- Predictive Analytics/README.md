# Project 2

Project Name: Customer Banking Behavior- Predictive Analytics.

Project Description:

The first rule of any business is to retain the existing customers rather than getting new customers. So, most companies target customer retention over customer acquisition. I want to analyze the success rate in customer retention through direct campaign marketing by a Portuguese Bank for which the data set pertains to. I mainly want to find out what parameters define the outcome of the direct campaign and what parameters are a must for a positive outcome leading to a subscription. The data set concentrates on only phone calls, so my research includes the effectiveness of the direct marketing campaign. The analysis includes feature engineering and feature selection as well to select features that define this success rate.
