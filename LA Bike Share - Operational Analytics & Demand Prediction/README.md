Project Name:  LA Bike Share - Operational Analytics & Demand Prediction

Project Description:

Building predictive model for predicting the usage rate for a given station, on a given day and hour. This helps to figure out the number of bikes that should be in stock to handle the demand of the riders.
Classifying the stations based on the number of bikes they rent â€“ using unsupervised clustering algorithms.
Predicting passholder that generates more revenue. For this predictive modelling, the cost for each pass holder type is taken from their website. This modelling is based on the assumption that bike rental costs are more or less same throughout the period for which data was considered.
Data Sources: In order to achieve our goal, we needed to combine our data from there different datasets. These Include

Bike Sharing Dataset (https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/)

Los Angeles Weather Data
